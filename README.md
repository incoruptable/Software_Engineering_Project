Group 3 - Pharmacy Shot-Tracking Application

Our project seeks to create an application usable by pharmacists and support staff to manage patients and inventory.
The application's primary function is to provide a platform for shot surveys that will be able to reference patient 
information to catch potentially disqualifying health conditions or other potentially harmful side-effects before 
the shot is administered. Secondary functions of the application will be patient profile management, inventory 
management and report generation.
